# Hacker News Explorer

A simple app that uses the **HackerNews API** and searches throught their articles. Built using **Vite** (React and Typescript template). No UI library or any CSS preprocessor are used.

### Functionality

- Highlight the term in the results
- Selected results can be added in (and removed from) a list
- If user is "logged in" the list and the username are persisted (browser's localstorage).
